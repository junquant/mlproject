## Problem Description

With the recent progress of wearable technology, monitoring of human activity becomes much more convenient. One of the important techniques in human activity monitoring is the activity recognition. With some physical parameters measurement of human body, a computer is smart enough to tell the activity carried out by a person,i.e. whether a person is sitting, running or climbing up stairs. 

This project works on an interesting problem to recognize human activities. It uses a dataset and predict the activities carried out by a person. To make the task more challenging, the person who carried out the activity is also predicted.

A few classifier models have been built: Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine classifier, Logistic Regression classifier

## Data Set

## Data Preparation
**Missing Values**
The missing values were caused by lost of signals. As such, missing values are populated with the last valid value for the subject and if there is no valid value before, the first valid value after the record was used.

Things that came up during discussions with prof

Potential Techniques
* Potential techniques not required in proposal yet
* Principle Component Analysis
* Decision Trees (may some ensemble?)
* SVM ?

Things to do 
* Predict the person
* Predict the activity
* Make the prediction 2 layers 
* first layer to classify the person
* second layer to classify the activity
* can also do a joint classifier 
* Need to interpret classifier (eg. speed to determine whether person is walking or running)
* for eg. what dimension needs to
