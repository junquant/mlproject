Things that came up during discussions with prof

Potential Techniques
* Potential techniques not required in proposal yet
* Principle Component Analysis
* Decision Trees (may some ensemble?)
* SVM ?

Things to do 
* Predict the person
* Predict the activity
* Make the prediction 2 layers 
* first layer to classify the person
* second layer to classify the activity
* can also do a joint classifier 
* Need to interpret classifier (eg. speed to determine whether person is walking or running)
* for eg. what dimension needs to
