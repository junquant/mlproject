# Proposal

## Problem
* Human Activity Recognition using Machine Learning techniques


## About the Data Set 
* PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset 
* 18 different physical activities, performed by 9 subjects
* [PAMAP2](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PAMAP2+Physical+Activity+Monitoring)
* Describe some properties of the data set
* Mean / Variance analysis
* run initial analysis on data set (eg. run PCA to look at data)
* describe the problem and approach

## What we Plan To Do With the Information
* think ... 

## Potential Techniques
* Potential techniques not required in proposal yet
* Principle Component Analysis
* Decision Trees (may some ensemble?)
* SVM ?

## Things to do 
* Predict the person
* Predict the activity
* Make the prediction 2 layers 
* first layer to classify the person
* second layer to classify the activity
* can also do a joint classifier 
* Need to interpret classifier (eg. speed to determine whether person is walking or running)
* for eg. what dimension needs to 

## Presentation
* 10 - 15 minutes
