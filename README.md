# Applied Machine Learning Repo

*Lets rock. I hope*

**code** - This is the directory for all data processing and learning codes.

**code_sample** - Use this directory to put sample codes you find or trying out
 
**data** - 
* Anything with extension .txt will be ignored by Git. 
* Safe to put .txt files here so that we dont have to change the path everytime we rerun the script. 
* Use relative paths instead of absolute .. 

**data_codebook** - UCI data codebooks

**presentation** - Use this directory to put our presentations

**references** - cheatsheets and references

**report** - proposal and report in md format

**results** - output of the individual models should come in here in this format
model|score|train_duration (in min)|method
-----|-----|--------------|------
naive_bayes|0.95|0.5|a>b
