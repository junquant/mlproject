# Applied Machine Learning Repo

*Lets rock. I hope*

**code** - This is the directory for all data processing and learning codes.

**code_sample** - Use this directory to put sample codes you find or trying out
 
**data** - 
* Anything with extension .txt will be ignored by Git. 
* Safe to put .txt files here so that we dont have to change the path everytime we rerun the script. 
* Use relative paths instead of absolute .. 

**data_codebook** - UCI data codebooks

**presentation** - Use this directory to put our presentations

**references** - cheatsheets and references

**report** - proposal and report in md format

**results** - output of the individual models should come in here in this format using a dictionary
* model: gaussian naive bayes
* score_activity: 0.95
* score_subject: 0.88
* score_both: 0.91
* dur_train_activity: 0.5
* dur_train_subj: 0.4
* dur_train_both: 0.9
* method:activity then subject / subject then activity / both
