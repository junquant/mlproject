# Machine Learning -- T.P.E

- Task: Predict the activity and the person performing the activity
- Performance: Percentage of actions and person performing the activity correctly classified
- Experience: PAMAP2 data set of labeled IMU readings available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

# PAMAP2 Data Set

- A Physical Activity Monitoring dataset

- 3 wireless inertial measurement units (IMU):
   - sampling frequency: 100Hz  on wrist, chest and ankle
   - Record temperature, acceleration, 3D-magnetometer data, 3D-gyroscope data, orientation...
   
- 1 heart rate monitor:
   - sampling frequency: ~9Hz

- Activities:
    --- | --- | --- | ---
    Lying | Sitting | Standing | Ironing
 	Vacuuming | Walking upstairs | Walking downstairs | Normal walk
	Nordic walk | Cycling, Running

# Model Construction Methods

1. Classify Subject (Person) --> Feed subject back into model to classify action of the subject
2. Classify Action --> Feed action back into model to the classify subject
3. Classify both subject and action simultaneously

# Data Preparation

* **Missing Values** - Back fill or Forward fill the empty value

* **Invalid Data** - Acceleration of Â±6g is saturated

* **Derived Subject-Activity** - Concatenate subject and activity 

# Data Exploration

##Univariate Distributions

![Univariate Distributions](../plots/var_distribution.png)

`heartrate_bpm`, `hand_temp_c`, `chest_temp_c` and `ankle_temp_c`, and `*_magnetometer_*` have greater variance

##Pair-wise Correlation Plot

![Pair-wise Correlations](../plots/correlation.png)

Strong correlations between several variables:

* `chest_temp_c` and `hand_temp_c`
* `chest_3d_magnetometer` and `chest_3d_accel`
* `ankle_3d_magnetometer` and `chest_3d_magnetometer`

##Principal Component Analysis

![Top 2 Principal Components](../plots/pca_2components.png)

![Top 3 Principal Components](../plots/pca_3components.png)

* PC1 has the strongest correlations with `chest_temp_c` , `hand_temp_c` , and `ankle_temp_c`
* PC2 has the strongest correlations with `heartrate_bpm`
* PC2 has the strongest correlations with `ankle_temp_c`

# Model Comparison

**Accuracy** and **Computational Complexity**: The classifiers used were the following:

* SVM with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Multi-output Classifier using the best model from initial comparison

##SVN with SGD



##Gaussian Naive Bayes

- with PCA

Method | Accuracy | Time Taken (seconds)
--- | --- | ---
S > A | 0.40 | 0.63 + 0.63
A > S | 0.50 | 0.63 + 0.59
Both | 0.64 | 0.95

- without PCA

Method | Accuracy | Time Taken (seconds)
--- | --- | ---
S > A | 0.54 | 1.36, 1.27
A > S | 0.54 | 1.43, 1.48
Both | 0.96 | 1.81

##Multi-output Classifier using the best model from initial comparison

Method | Accuracy | Time Taken (seconds)
--- | --- | ---
Multi-Output | 0.96 | 1.81
